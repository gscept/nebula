@section NebulaMemorySystem The Memory Library

The Nebula Memory subsystem implements custom memory allocation mechanisms which 
provide higher performance and better debugging aids. This library is quite thin, but it does implement certain vital platform-specific stuff like Win32 Heap management. It also includes two specialized allocators, for example an arena allocator which allocates fixed-sized blocks of memory and returns a pointer to them, useful for low-fragmentation allocations of random types, like when allocating subclasses dynamically, based on FourCC or some other runtime behavior.
