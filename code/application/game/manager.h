    @class Game::Manager
    
    Managers are Singleton objects which care about some "specific global 
    stuff". They should be defined by applications to implement
    globals aspects of the application (mainly global game play related).
    
    Managers are created and triggered by game features. The frame trigger
    functions are invoked when the gameserver triggers the game feature.
    
    Standard-Nebula uses several managers to offer timing information
    (TimeManager), manage game entities (EntityManager) and so forth.
