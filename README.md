Check out the documentation (WIP) here: https://gscept.github.io/nebula-doc/

## Requirements
1. OS: Windows and Linux(WIP)
2. Compiler with support for C++17.
3. GPU and drivers supporting Vulkan 1.2+
4. [CMake 3.13+](https://cmake.org/download/)
5. [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads)
    * Python requirements (Windows):
        1. Matching architecture (64-bit if you're building for 64-bit systems)
        2. Installed for all users
        3. Added to PATH
        4. Installed with debugging symbols and binaries

## Setup

#### Setup config

1. `./fips set config vulkan-win64-vs2019-debug` in your project directory

#### Set environment variables

Run `fips nebula` verb to set work and toolkit directory registry variables:

  * `fips nebula set work {PATH}`
  * `fips nebula set toolkit {PATH}`
  
#### Build project

In your project directory:
  
  1. `fips fetch`
  2. `fips physx build win-vs16` (if you are running VS 2017, use `win-vs15` instead)
  2. `fips anyfx setup`
  3. `fips build`
  4. `fips physx deploy`

## Features
Nebula is being developed continuously, which means that features keep getting added all the time. Currently, we support this:

* Completely data-driven design from bottom to top.
* Data structure suite, from containers to OS wrappers, everything is designed for performance and minimal call stacks.
* Multithreading.
* SSE-accelerated and intuitive maths library.
* Full python supported scripting layer.
* Advanced rendering framework and shaders.
* Test-benches and benchmarking.
* Profiling tools.

#### Rendering
A lot of effort has been made to the Nebula rendering subsystem, where we currently support:

* Unified clustering system - fog volumes, decals and lights all go into the same structure.
* Screen-space reflections - working condition, but still work in progress.
* SSAO - Horizon-based ambient occlusion done in compute.
* Physically based materials and rendering.
* Multi-threaded subpass recording.
* Shadow mapping for local lights and CSM for global/directional/sun light.
* Volumetric fog and lighting.
* Geometric decals. 
* CPU-GPU hybrid particle system.
* Skinning and animation.
* Scripted rendering path.
* Vulkan.
* Tonemapping.
* Asynchronous compute.
* Virtual texturing using sparse binding.
* Fast and conservative GPU memory allocation.

#### Entity system
Nebula has historically had a database-centric approach to entities.
With the newest iteration of Nebula, we've decided to keep improving by adopting an ECS approach, still keeping it database-centric.

* Data-oriented
* Data-driven
* Minimal memory overhead per entity.
* High performance without compromising usability or simplicity
* Blueprint and template system for easily instantiating and categorizing entity types.
* Automatic serialization and deserialization
