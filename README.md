Check out the documentation (WIP) here: https://gscept.github.io/nebula-doc/

## Requirements
1. OS: Windows and Linux(WIP)
2. Compiler with support for C++20.
3. GPU and drivers supporting Vulkan 1.2+
4. [CMake 3.21+](https://cmake.org/download/)
5. [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads)
    * Python requirements (Windows):
        1. Matching architecture (64-bit if you're building for 64-bit systems)
        2. Installed for all users
        3. Added to PATH
        4. Installed with debugging symbols and binaries

## Setup

There are a few simple projects in the test folder, but a more interesting project is available as well [Nebula-demo](https://github.com/gscept/nebula-demo).
Fips will take care of getting the relevant dependencies (including the actual engine in case you are setting up a external project)

#### Setup config

1. `fips set config win64-vstudio-debug` in your project directory, e.g. the cloned nebula-demo. There are other configs available, see in fips-files/configs
2. `fips fetch` Downloads/checks out all the other required repositories

#### Select the project and source directory

Run `fips nebula` verb to set work and toolkit directory registry variables:

  * `fips nebula set work {PATH}` (If you are building an external project, this would be the current path)
  * `fips nebula set toolkit {PATH}` (this is the path to where the nebula checkout resides, if an external project that would be ../nebula)

#### Build project

In your project directory:
  
  1. `fips physx build vc17 debug` (if you are running VS 2022, use `vc16` or `vc15` for vs 2019/2017 instead)
  2. `fips anyfx setup`
  3. `fips ultralight`
  4. `fips gen` to generate the required build system files, e.g. a visual studio solution
  5. `fips build` to directly compile the project
     or
     `fips open` to open the generated solution in your selected environment
     
## Features
Nebula is being developed continuously, which means that features keep getting added all the time. Currently, we support this:

* Completely data-driven design from bottom to top.
* Data structure suite, from containers to OS wrappers, everything is designed for performance and minimal call stacks.
* Multithreading.
* SSE-accelerated and intuitive maths library.
* Full python supported scripting layer.
* Advanced rendering framework and shaders.
* Test-benches and benchmarking.
* Profiling tools.

#### Rendering
A lot of effort has been made to the Nebula rendering subsystem, where we currently support:

* Unified clustering system - fog volumes, decals and lights all go into the same structure.
* Screen-space reflections - working condition, but still work in progress.
* Horizon-based ambient occlusion done in compute.
* Physically based materials and rendering.
* Multi-threaded subpass recording.
* Shadow mapping for local lights and CSM for global/directional/sun light.
* Volumetric fog and lighting.
* Geometric decals. 
* CPU-GPU hybrid particle system.
* Skinning and animation.
* Scripted rendering path.
* Vulkan.
* Tonemapping.
* Asynchronous compute.
* Virtual texturing using sparse binding.
* Adaptive virtual textured terrain.
* Fast and conservative GPU memory allocation.
* Area lights.

#### Entity system
Nebula has historically had a database-centric approach to entities.
With the newest iteration of Nebula, we've decided to keep improving by adopting an ECS approach, still keeping it database-centric.

* Data-oriented
* Data-driven
* Minimal memory overhead per entity.
* High performance without compromising usability or simplicity
* Blueprint and template system for easily instantiating and categorizing entity types.
* Automatic serialization and deserialization
